# IoT-Rank-Attack-Detection-ML
This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for detecting **Rank Attacks** in **RPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks)** â€” a critical security threat in IoT systems. The solution explores both **supervised and unsupervised learning techniques** using a custom dataset derived from RPL traffic simulations.
